"""Encoder-only (bidirectional) self-attention for Spyre without a KV cache.

Selected by ``TorchSpyrePlatform.get_attn_backend_cls`` for ENCODER/ENCODER_ONLY
layers. Operates on direct Q/K/V tensors rather than the paged KV-cache path.

Attention runs over the packed ``[T, H, D]`` token list; request boundaries ride
in int32 row-index tables, so a card never does offset arithmetic on *shapes* --
offsets are data. Requests sharing a padded length are served by one
gather/attend/store (opt-in, ``SPYRE_ENCODER_BATCHED_ATTN``), since these
kernels are dispatch-bound rather than compute-bound.

Three separately compiled functions, and the split is the point: under
``dynamic=False`` Dynamo keys on every argument's exact shape, so folding the
gather and store into the attention math would make the expensive graph
recompile per ``(buffer_rows, extent)`` instead of per ``extent``. Gather and
store are cheap and keyed on the step's buffer size; the attention math is keyed
only on the sequence's own padded length.

Two torch-spyre bugs shape the design. A compiled region reads its arguments
from offset 0 and ignores ``storage_offset`` (#3770), so a sequence is gathered
with ``index_select`` rather than sliced.

No fallbacks: there is no on-device ``arange`` or ``full``, so every index and
mask tensor here is built on the host, ``convert``'d once, then cached and
reused across sequences, layers and steps.
